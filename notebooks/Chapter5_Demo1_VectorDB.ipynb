one in four of all deaths in the united states approximately death every minute or deaths each year greater mortality rate than for all forms of cancer combined the annual economic impact of cardiac disease exceeds billion with ischemic heart disease contributing well over half moreover roughly one third of these deaths are premature occurring in individuals younger than years of age thus an additional economic burden is imposed through lost years of productivity although wide range of diseases can affect the cardiovascular system the pathways that result in broken heart distill down to six principal mechanisms failure of the pump in the most common situation the cardiac muscle contracts weakly and the chambers cannot empty properly so called systolic dysfunction in some cases the muscle cannot relax sufficiently to permit ventricular filling resulting in diastolic dysfunction obstruction to flow lesions that prevent valve opening calcific aortic valve stenosis or cause increased ventricular chamber pressures systemic hypertension or aortic coarctation can overwork the myocardium which has to pump against the obstruction regurgitant flow valve pathology that allows backward flow of blood results in increased volume workload and may overwhelm the pumping capacity of the affected chambers shunted flow defects congenital or acquired that divert blood inappropriately from one chamber to another or from one vessel to another lead to pressure and volume overloads disorders of cardiac conduction uncoordinated cardiac impulses or blocked conduction pathways can cause arrhythmias that slow contractions or prevent effective pumping altogether rupture of the heart or major vessel loss of circulatory continuity gunshot wound through the thoracic aorta may lead to massive blood loss hypotensive shock and death http ebooksmedicine net heart failure often referred to as congestive heart failure chf is the common end point for many forms of cardiac disease and typically is progressive condition with poor prognosis in the united states alone over million individuals are affected resulting in well over million annually and financial burden in excess of billion roughly one half of patients die within years of receiving diagnosis of chf and in deaths in the united states include heart failure as contributory cause chf occurs when the heart cannot generate sufficient output to meet the metabolic demands of the tissues or can only do so at higher than normal filling pressures in minority of cases heart failure is consequence of greatly increased tissue demands as in hyperthyroidism or decreased oxygen carrying capacity as in anemia highoutput failure the onset of chf is sometimes abrupt as in the setting of large myocardial infarct or acute valve dysfunction in most cases however chf develops gradually and insidiously owing to the cumulative effects of chronic work overload or progressive loss of myocardium heart failure may result from systolic or diastolic dysfunction systolic dysfunction results from inadequate myocardial contractile function usually as consequence of ischemic heart disease or hypertension diastolic dysfunction refers to an inability of the heart to adequately relax and fill which may be consequence of massive left ventricular hypertrophy myocardial fibrosis amyloid deposition or constrictive pericarditis approximately one half of chf cases are attributable to diastolic dysfunction with greater frequency seen in older adults diabetic patients and women heart failure may also be caused by valve dysfunction due to endocarditis or may occur following rapid increases in blood volume or blood pressure even if the heart is normal when the failing heart can no longer efficiently pump blood there is an increase in end diastolic ventricular volumes increased end diastolic pressures and elevated venous pressures thus inadequate cardiac output called forward failure is almost always accompanied by increased congestion of the venous circulation that is backward failure although the root problem in chf typically is deficient cardiac function virtually every other organ is eventually affected by some combination of forward and backward failure the cardiovascular system attempts to compensate for reduced myocardial contractility or increased hemodynamic burden through several homeostatic mechanisms the frank starling mechanism increased end diastolic filling volumes dilate the heart and cause increased cardiac myofiber stretching these lengthened fibers contract more forcibly thereby increasing cardiac output if the dilated ventricle is able to maintain cardiac output by this means the patient is said to be in compensated heart failure however ventricular dilation comes at the expense of increased wall tension and magnifies the oxygen requirements of an already compromised myocardium with time the failing muscle is no longer able to propel sufficient blood to meet the needs of the body and the patient develops decompensated heart failure activation of neurohumoral systems release of the norepinephrine by the autonomic nervous system increases heart rate and augments myocardial contractility and vascular resistance activation of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system spurs water and salt retention augmenting circulatory volume and increases vascular tone release of atrial natriuretic peptide acts to balance the renin angiotensin aldosterone system through diuresis and vascular smooth muscle relaxation myocardial structural

diseases these can be primary that is principally confined to the myocardium or secondary presenting as the cardiac manifestation of systemic disorder are thus diverse group that includes inflammatory disorders myocarditis immunologic diseases sarcoidosis systemic metabolic disorders hemochromatosis muscular dystrophies and genetic disorders of myocardial fibers in many cases the cardiomyopathy is of unknown etiology and thus is termed idiopathic however number of previously idiopathic have been shown to be the consequence of specific genetic abnormalities in cardiac energy metabolism or in structural and contractile proteins can be classified according to variety of criteria including the underlying genetic basis of dysfunction indeed some of the arrhythmia inducing channelopathies that are included in some classifications of cardiomyopathy were alluded to earlier for purposes of general diagnosis and therapy however three time honored clinical functional and pathologic patterns are recognized fig table of the three major patterns dcm is most common of cases and restrictive cardiomyopathy is the least frequent within each pattern there is spectrum of clinical severity and in some cases clinical features overlap among the groups in addition each of these patterns can be caused by specific identifiable cause or can be idiopathic see table dilated cardiomyopathy dcm is characterized by progressive cardiac dilation and contractile systolic dysfunction usually with concurrent hypertrophy regardless of the cause the patterns are similar http ebooksmedicine net fig ao aorta la leftatrium lv leftventricle although many individuals with dcm have familial genetic form dcm can also result from various acquired myocardial insults these include the following myocarditis an inflammatory disorder that precedes the development of cardiomyopathy in at least some cases and is sometimes caused by viral infections table functional patterns causes toxicities including adverse effects of agents and chronic alcoholism history of which can be elicited in to of patients pregnancy so called peripartum cardiomyopathy by the time it is diagnosed dcm has frequently already progressed to end stage disease the heart is dilated and poorly contractile and at autopsy or cardiac transplant fails to reveal any specific pathologic features nevertheless genetic and epidemiologic studies suggest that at least five general pathways can lead to end stage dcm fig genetic causes dcm has hereditary basis in to of cases over genes are known to be mutated in this form of cardiomyopathy with autosomal dominant inheritance being the predominant pattern mutations affecting cytoskeletal proteins or proteins that link the sarcomere to the cytoskeleton cardiac actin are most commonly involved linked dcm is most frequently associated with mutatons in dystrophin cell membrane protein that physically couples the intracellular cytoskeleton to the ecm chapter uncommon forms of dcm are caused by mutations of mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation or fatty acid oxidation presumably leading to defective atp generation other genetic forms of dcm include those with mutations in cytoskeletal proteins such as desmin the principal intermediate filament protein in cardiac myocytes and the nuclear lamins and since contractile myocytes and conduction fibers share common developmental pathway congenital conduction abnormalities also can be feature of inherited forms of dcm infection the nucleic acid footprints of coxsackievirus and other enteroviruses can occasionally be detected in the myocardium from late stage dcm patients moreover sequential endomyocardial biopsies have documented instances in which infectious myocarditis progressed to dcm simply finding viral transcripts or demonstrating elevated anti viral antibody titers may be sufficient to invoke myocarditis that was missed in its early stages consequently many cases of dcm are attributed to viral infections even though inflammation is absent from the end stage heart alcohol or other toxic exposure alcohol abuse is strongly associated with the development of

chapter dcm also can develop after exposure to other toxic agents such as cobalt and particularly doxorubicin adriamycin drug peripartum cardiomyopathy occurs late in gestation or several weeks to months postpartum the etiology is multifactorial including pregnancy associated hypertension volume overload nutritional deficiency metabolic derangements gestational diabetes and or immunologic responses recent work suggests that the primary defect is impaired angiogenesis within the myocardium leading to ischemic injury antiangiogenic cleavage products of the hormone prolactin which rises late in pregnancy and placental derived antagonists to the vegf have been implicated fortunately approximately one half of these patients spontaneously recover normal function iron overload in the heart can result either from hereditary hemochromatosis chapter or from multiple transfusions iron overload also can cause restrictive cardiomyopathy due to interstitial fibrosis but dcm is the most common manifestation it has been attributed to interference with metal dependent enzyme systems or to injury caused by iron mediated production of reactive oxygen species andflabby fig equalto mural thrombi bydefinition stretched andirregular missed myocarditis the fundamental defect in dcm is ineffective contraction thus in end stage dcm the cardiac ejection fraction typically is less than

developing countries have led to calls for preventive policies to improve diet increase exercise and restrict tobacco use along with the prescription of multidrug regimens for persons at high level vascular risk although this agenda could do much to prevent pandemic ncd it will do little to help persons with established heart disease stemming from nonatherogenic pathologies cardiovascular disease because systemic investigation of the causes of stroke and heart failure in sub saharan africa has begun only recently little is known about the impact of elevated blood pressure in this portion of the continent modestly elevated blood pressure in the absence of tobacco use in populations with low rates of obesity may confer little risk of adverse events in the short run in contrast persistently elevated blood pressure above goes largely undetected untreated and uncontrolled in this part of the world in the cohort of men assessed in the framingham heart study the prevalence of blood pressures above severe hypertension declined from in the to by the with the introduction of effective agents although debate continues about appropriate screening strategies and treatment thresholds rural health centers staffed largely by nurses must quickly gain access to essential medications the epidemiology of heart failure reflects inequalities in risk factor prevalence and in treatment the reported burden of this condition has remained unchanged since the but the causes of heart failure and the age of the people affected vary across the globe heart failure as consequence of pericardial myocardial endocardial or valvular injury accounts for as many as of all medical admissions to hospitals around the world in high income countries coronary artery disease and hypertension among the elderly account for most cases of heart failure for example in the united states coronary artery disease is present in of patients with heart failure and hypertension in among the world poorest billion people however heart failure reflects poverty driven exposure of children and young adults to rheumatogenic strains of streptococci and cardiotropic microorganisms hiv trypanosoma cruzi enteroviruses tuberculosis untreated high blood pressure and nutrient deficiencies the mechanisms underlying other causes of heart failure common in these populations such as idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy peripartum cardiomyopathy and endomyocardial fibrosis remain unclear in stark contrast to the extraordinary lengths to which clinicians in wealthy countries will go

associated cardiomyopathy multidrug regimens that include beta blockers angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and other agents can dramatically reduce mortality risk and improve quality of life for these patients lessons learned in the scale up of chronic care for hiv infection and tb may be illustrative as progress is made in establishing the means to deliver heart failure therapies some of the lessons learned from the chronic infections discussed above are of course relevant to cardiovascular disease especially those classified as ncds but caused by infectious pathogens integration of prevention and care remains as important today as in when paul dudley white and his colleagues found little evidence of myocardial infarction in the region near the albert schweitzer hospital in lambaréné gabon but reported that the high prevalence of mitral stenosis is astonishing we believe strongly that it is duty to help bring to these sufferers the benefits of better penicillin prophylaxis and of cardiac surgery when indicated the same responsibility exists for those with correctable congenital cardiovascular defects rhd affects more than million people worldwide with more than new cases each year among the million annual cases of pediatric rhd an estimated occur in sub saharan africa this disease which may cause endocarditis or stroke leads to more than deaths per year almost all occurring in developing countries researchers in ethiopia have reported annual death rates as high as in rural areas in part because the prevention of rhd has not advanced since the disease disappearance in wealthy countries no part of sub saharan africa has eradicated rhd despite examples of success in costa rica cuba and some caribbean nations survey of acute heart failure among adults in sub saharan africa showed that of these cases were due to rhd strategies to eliminate rheumatic heart disease may depend on active case finding with confirmation by among high risk groups as well as on efforts to expand access to surgical interventions among children with advanced valvular damage partnerships between established surgical programs and areas with limited or nonexistent facilities may help expand the capacity to provide life saving interventions to patients who otherwise would die early and painfully long term goal is the establishment of regional centers of excellence equipped to provide consistent accessible high quality services clinicians from tertiary care centers in sub saharan africa and elsewhere have continued to call for prevention and treatment
